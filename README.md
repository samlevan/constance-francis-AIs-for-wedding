# What this is

This is a gift the wedding of my old friend Francis and his wife Constance ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ó

This code creates simple AI avatars for Francis and Constance and simulate conversations between the two of them after being given a "scenario".

# How to use it

### Setup
Add an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` with a OpenAI API key.

### Run
Simply run index.js. Press enter to get the response from each avatar.

You can change the scenario it runs (defined as a `situation` and a `retention`) by editing the `scenarios.js` file.
